CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) IN EMOTION DETECTION USING MASKED FACIAL IMAGES

The researchers innovate a solution for detecting emotion with a mask-on. As the pandemic started classification of emotion in facial images becomes complex for most of the researcher as it covers 60 percent of the face, the goal of the study is to contribute to computer science studies by studying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm and strategies that cope with the mask barrier of emotion detection. The researcher approach is to use the CNN algorithm to classify the emotion of the image and use AffectNet datasets
